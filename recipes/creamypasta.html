    <h2>Creamy Parmesan Pasta</h2>
    <p>This simple creamy, cheesy white sauce is a versatile base for many pasta dishes. It's perfect for a quick weeknight meal when time is a priority and the day has long run. The classic flavors of heavy cream and parmesan make this a delicious and fulfilling comfort food.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/3 cup reserved pasta water (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter and add the olive oil to the pan or skillet over medium heat.</li><br>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant and not brown or burnt.</li><br>
        <li>Slowly pour the heavy cream into the pan while whisking constantly to help emulsify the sauce.</li><br>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the solution begins to thicken.</li><br>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the grated parmesan cheese a small amount at a time, ensuring each batch is melted and fully incorporated into the sauce before adding more.</li><br>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to personal preference. If the sauce is too thick, use some of the reserved pasta water to dilute the sauce to your preference.</li><br>
        <li>Toss the cooked pasta in the sauce and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't burn the garlic.</strong> When saut√©ing the garlic, keep the heat low and continuously stir. Burnt garlic will taste bitter and ruin the flavor of the sauce.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Use a whisk.</strong> Whisking consistently and vigorously while adding the liquid ingredients prevents lumps and helps ensure a smooth sauce.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Simmer, don't boil.</strong> When reducing a cream based sauce, bring to a gentle simmer rather than a rolling boil. High heat can separate the cream.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Emulsify with pasta water.</strong> Before you drain your cooked pasta, save about a cup of the starchy water. Adding a little at a time to your sauce helps it bind the fat and liquid, creating a smooth sauce.</li>
